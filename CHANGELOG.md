## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Request Process page (`Approved-Tools/request-process.mdx`) explaining the IT front door for requesting software, AI tools, and IT projects, with image cards linking to the IT Help Center and Portfolio Manager lookup
- What Are AI Agents article (`How-AI-Works/what-are-ai-agents.mdx`) explaining AI agents, their components (model, tools, orchestration), the distinction between workflows and agents, and current capabilities and limitations
- What Are Tokens article (`Learn-About-AI/tokens.mdx`) explaining tokens, tokenization, context windows, multimodal tokens, and token economics for a non-technical audience
- Cross-references from How LLMs Are Trained and Managing Context articles linking to the new What Are Tokens article
- Naming conventions reference document (`.claude/reference-docs/naming-conventions.md`) defining label hierarchy, terminology rules, and title patterns for consistent labeling across all site surfaces
- Dedicated Teaching with AI landing page (`teaching-with-ai.mdx`) separated from the AI in Academics content page
- Shared nav config (`preview-site/nav.config.js`) as single source of truth for navigation, with `generate-navbar.js` script to auto-generate `Website/navbar.mdx`
- Check 5: Naming & IA Consistency added to the `genai-site-reviewer` skill, cross-referencing labels across frontmatter, H1, navbar, landing page cards, and CLAUDE.md
- New `genai-site-reviewer` skill for auditing content pages against all five reference documents (Church guidance, strategy, objectives, landing pages, data classification) with checks for objectives alignment, strategy alignment, Church principles alignment, and editorial compliance
- Reference documents for AI strategy, governance objectives, landing page structure, and Church AI guiding principles in `.claude/reference-docs/`
- Project Knowledge section in CLAUDE.md with rules for referencing all five reference documents (Church guidance, strategy, objectives, landing pages, data classification)
- Per-page directives for Teaching with AI, Working with AI, and Learning with AI landing pages with audience-specific structure (Topics & Standards, Training Resources, Available Tools)

### Changed

- Renamed "Tools" to "Approved Tools" and "Copyright" to "AI and Copyright" for clarity
- Standardized terminology: "AI" used everywhere except site name; removed "Artificial Intelligence" from page titles on grading-with-ai, copyright, and academic-integrity pages

- Updated all `.md` file references to `.mdx` across landing pages, cross-references, and documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md: directory tree, navigation section, file inventory, progress table, per-page directives, and project knowledge section all synced with current file structure

   - *This file DOES not get included on the website. It's simply a reference document for the web dev team*
